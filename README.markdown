stunjelly CMS template working directory

IDEAS
-----

AIM: build a simple CMS framework thats easy to drop content/mods/templates into without being confined/directed to purpose from installation.

CORE: authentication, admin panel, database, addon bootstrap, template engine, probably other things

ADDONS: primary, secondary, tertiary.

	primary- major directional blocks i.e: blog, forum, pages, commerce, portfolio, other things that the internet is used for
	secondary- bits and peices to fleshout primaries.
	tertiary- universal/global functions/elements 	

TEMPLATE/THEME: I have no idea how this would work, either wordpress esk or TPL/smarty esk

INSTALLATION: never done this could be interesting, was thinking about repackaging custom modules.

REMOTE UPDATES: ???

PLAN
----

I don't have one at the minute.
